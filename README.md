Worse Barrels successor for Fabric 1.15.2!

Package Crafter model by [Kat](https://kat.blue)!

### Why not port Worse Barrels directly?

* It relies on Forge `IItemHandler` stuff for its barrel magic.
* I want to take a different, less lazy-on-my-part approach to customizing your containers (choose your own blocks!)
* The code in Worse Barrels is kind of a hacked together mess, and with more experience (and with the mod idea pinned down, instead of hastily adding on features as I think of them) a rewrite isn't too bad of an idea. It's a fairly small mod anyways.
* "Barrels" is used in the original mod referring to "barrel" in the classical modded sense, but vanilla barrels added in 1.13 don't follow that pattern so the name doesn't make any sense anyways. New name, new mod, new me, I guess.
